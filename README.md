# 379ThreadFactoryLab2
This repo contains the files necessary to complete the task of helping a factory with a new software system to emulate its assembly line. The factory vision is implemented using a bound-buffer solution. The factory contains two types of worker threads -- assemblers and packer.Each assembler will produce a single color of product; each packer will create a box of products of assorted colors. Assemblers produce one product at a time and then place the product (when there is room) on the assembly line (a limited-sized buffer). Packers remove one product at a time from the assembly line until they have enough products to fill a box. Once a box of products has been filled the packer will send an alert and begin filling a new box.
